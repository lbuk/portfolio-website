Housing is volumetric. Data on the horizontal stratification of buildings, for instance, is three-dimensional. Traditional ways of mapping three-dimensional space in the built environment can be cluttered and difficult to read. How do you visualise the three-dimensional horizontal stratification of buildings in 2D in a way that's more intuitive?

An experimental solution to this problem is to horizontally stratify maps of building footprints. These designs show building floors as horizontal strata in two-dimensional building footprints. The floors of the building can therefore be stacked horizontally in an abstracted map.

Although there are several limitations to this highly abstracted technique, it could provide an alternative way of mapping volumetric data on the horizontal stratification of buildings for communities.
