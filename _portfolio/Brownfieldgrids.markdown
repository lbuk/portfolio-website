Brownfieldgrids is an <a href="https://github.com/lbuk/brownfieldgrids">R package</a> for creating maps of brownfield land in London using the 2018 Brownfield Register, OpenStreetMap and the 2009-2010 National Land Use Database (NLUD). The package provides functions for creating minimalistic and exploratory maps of brownfield sites.

The tool for mapping brownfield land formed part of an MSc project at The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London.

The aim of the project was to provide a spatial and temporal analysis of brownfield land at city-level, district-level and street-level using a variety of urban data sources such as the 2018 Brownfield Register, the 2009-2010 NLUD and OpenStreetMap. 

In the process, the project not only developed the brownfieldgrids tool, it also revealed new insights about previously developed land in London between 2009-2010 and 2018. For example, it found that the total area of brownfield land in outer London increased between 2009-2010 and 2018 while brownfield land in inner London decreased. 

The study also found that small brownfield sites (i.e. less than 0.25 hectares in size) had a stronger presence in the 2018 Brownfield Register compared to the 2009-2010 NLUD. This was echoed in the Greater London Authority's 2017 London Plan, a city-wide strategy for spatial development, which made a strong case for increasing the delivery of new homes on small brownfield sites.
