As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to explore new ways to measure and map densification.

Airspace Ratio (AR) describes the ratio of the existing Floor Area Ratio to the Airspace Floor Area Ratio. The latter effectively creates a volumetric parcel of air to outline available space according to the planning or policy context. 

Airspace Ratio calculates the extent to which buildings make use of space: the lower the Airspace Ratio, the more room there is for residential extensions, for instance.

Airspace Ratio and Airspace Floor Area Ratio are techniques that, if utilised cautiously and contextually, could be deployed by planners and designers to compare density scenarios and facilitate sustainable densification. I apply the techniques to convey the amount of space available for new rooftop homes in London.
