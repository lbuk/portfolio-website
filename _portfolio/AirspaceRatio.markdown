As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to explore new ways to measure and map densification. Airspace Ratio is a new 3D measure of density.

Airspace Ratio describes the ratio of the existing Floor Area Ratio to the Airspace Floor Area Ratio. The latter effectively creates a volumetric parcel of air that outlines available space according to the planning or policy context. Airspace Ratio calculates the extent to which buildings make use of space: the lower the Airspace Ratio, the more room there is for residential extensions, for instance.

Airspace Ratio (AR) and Airspace Floor Area Ratio (AFAR) are tools that, if utilised cautiously and contextually, could be deployed by planners and designers to compare scenarios and facilitate sustainable densification.
