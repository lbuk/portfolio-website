As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to explore new ways to measure, map and simulate densification. Airspace Ratio (AR) describes the ratio of the Airspace Area (AA) as outlined by the planning or policy context to the Total Existing Floorspace (F). Airspace Ratio is a new technique that calculates the extent to which buildings could make use of airspace: the higher the Airspace Ratio, the more space there is for residential extensions, for instance.
