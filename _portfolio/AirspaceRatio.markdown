As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to explore new ways to measure and map densification. Airspace Ratio (AR) describes the ratio of the Airspace Area (AA) as outlined by the planning or policy context to the Total Existing Floorspace (F). Airspace Ratio is a new measure of density that calculates the extent to which buildings could make use of airspace: the higher the Airspace Ratio, the more room there is for residential extensions, for instance.
