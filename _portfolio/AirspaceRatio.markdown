As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to create new measures and maps of the density potential in cities.

Airspace Ratio (AR) describes the ratio of the existing Floor Area Ratio to the Airspace Floor Area Ratio (AFAR). The latter effectively creates a volumetric parcel of air to outline available space according to the planning or policy context. Unlike many other measures such as Permissable Floor Area Ratio, AFAR incorporates the planning context such as existing densities. Airspace Ratio calculates the extent to which buildings make use of space: the lower the Airspace Ratio, the more room there is for residential extensions, for instance.

Airspace Ratio and Airspace Floor Area Ratio are techniques that, if utilised cautiously and contextually, could be deployed by planners and designers to compare density scenarios and facilitate sustainable densification. I apply the techniques to develop new measures and maps that convey the amount of space available for new rooftop homes from the building-level to the area-level in London.
