The Codex Atlanticus 221v-b depicts a diagram with a set of consecutive circles. Each crescent has the same area as the central circle. Utilised by the likes of Fresnel and March, this technique has been applied in various fields including architecture and civil engineering.

Here, Fresnel's circles have been utilised as part of a novel cartographic technique. This technique is well-suited to addressing the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), in which geographic data is aggregated to administrative areas such as boroughs that may be unequal in terms of area. 

Fresnel's circles have been centred on Dulwich town centre in the London Borough of Southwark. The circles have been mapped thematically using a random and illustrative dataset. Each 'doughnut' has the same area as the central circle, which has a radius of 100m. The points-based data has been aggregated to each circle/doughnut area. This mapping technique, titled the 'Fresnel Map', could be applied in the fields of spatial analysis and epidemiology.
