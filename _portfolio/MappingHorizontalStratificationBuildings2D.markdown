Housing is volumetric. Data on the horizontal stratification of ownership in buildings, for instance, is volumetric. However, traditional ways of mapping three-dimensional urban data can be cluttered and difficult to read.

An experimental solution to this problem is to horizontally stratify two-dimensional maps of building footprints. The designs below show building floors as horizontal strata with equal areas. The floors can then be stacked in abstracted maps.

This technique could be used to create 'mental maps' of buildings using three-dimensional data. For example, it could provide an alternative way for communities to map the horizontal stratification of buildings and the verticalisation of empty housing.
