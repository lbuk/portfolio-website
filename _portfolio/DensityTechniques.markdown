As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to explore new ways to measure, map and simulate densification. Air Rights Ratio (ARR) describes the ratio of the Air Rights Area (ARA) as outlined by the planning or policy context to the Total Existing Floorspace (EF). Air Rights Ratio is a new technique that calculates the extent to which buildings could make use of airspace: the higher the Air Rights Ratio, the more space there is for residential extensions, for instance.
