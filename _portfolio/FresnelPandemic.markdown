**Background**  
   Coronavirus is having an unprecedented effect on population health and society. A variety of measures have been implementented to tackle COVID-19. While social distancing is by no means a substitute for wearing a face mask or getting vaccinated, it is an important way of reducing the spread of the virus. In summary, the further away you are from other people, the less likely you are to get COVID-19. 

Social distancing measures <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52522460">differ from place to place</a>. While the UK recommends people maintain a distance of at least 2 metres, several countries - including France, China, Hong Kong, Denmark, Singapore and Lithuania - recommend a minimum distance of only 1 metre. In addition, other countries suggest a minimum distance of 1.4m (South Korea), 1.5m (Belgium, Australia, Italy, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Germany, Portugal) or 1.8m (US). Comparing the effectiveness of the different social distancing rules is compounded by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). The MAUP occurs when data is aggregated to the level of spaces or districts that may be unequal in terms of area.

**Methodology**  
   Drawing on the <a href="https://www.liamthomasbolton.com/portfolio/FresnelMap/">Fresnel Map</a>, a novel cartographic technique, the effectiveness of the various social distancing rules can be compared. According to the Fresnel Map, each 'doughnut' has the same area as the central circle. In this particular example, the radius of the central circle is 1m. The successive zones therefore have radii of 1.41m, 1.73m, 2m, 2.24m, 2.45m and so on. The social distancing rules can be placed within these zones. Alternatively, the zones can be altered by varying the radius of the central circle. Using software that enables the simulation of multiple scenarios, my methodology involves placing a theoretical person with COVID-19 in the centre and then counting the number of people that get the virus in each equally-sized zone. The zones can then be thematically shaded as per the Fresnel Map.

**Applications**  
   This methodology has significant applications in epidemiology and policy-making. It could be utilised to address the MAUP in disease modelling and compare multiple pandemic measures.
