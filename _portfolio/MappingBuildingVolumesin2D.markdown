Housing is volumetric. Data on the horizontal stratification of buildings, for instance, is three-dimensional. Traditional ways of mapping volumetric 3D data on urban space can be difficult to read, particualarly for non-practitioners and communities. How do you visualise the three-dimensional horizontal stratification of buildings in 2D in a way that's more inituitive?

A very experimental solution to this problem is to horizontally stratify building footprints. These designs show the floors as horizontal strata in the 2D building footprint. The floors of the building can therefore be stacked horizontally in an abstracted map.

Although there are several limitations to this highly abstracted technique, it could in some cases provide an alternative to traditional ways of mapping volumetric built environment data. It could be used to visualise volumetric planning data - including the stratification of buildings - engagingly to communities.
