Comparing the spread of disease across different spatial scales is compounded by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). The MAUP occurs when data is aggregated to the level of areas that may be unequal in terms of area. For example, COVID-19 social distancing measures <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52522460">differ from place to place</a>. While the UK recommended people maintain a distance of at least 2 metres, several countries - including France, China, Hong Kong, Denmark, Singapore and Lithuania - recommended a minimum distance of only 1 metre. In addition, other countries suggested a minimum distance of 1.4m (South Korea), 1.5m (Belgium, Australia, Italy, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Germany, Portugal) or 1.8m (US). 

Drawing on Fresnel's circles and the <a href="https://www.liamthomasbolton.com/portfolio/FresnelMap/">Fresnel Map</a>, the spread of disease across different scales - including the effectiveness of social distancing rules - can be compared. According to Fresnel's circles, each 'doughnut' has the same area as the central circle. In this illustrative example, the radius of the central circle is 1m and the successive zones have radii of 1.41m, 1.73m, 2m, 2.24m, and 2.45m. Alternatively, the zones can be altered by varying the radius of the central circle.

By computing multiple scenarios, a hypothetical person with COVID-19 can be placed in the centre and the number of people that get the virus in each equally-sized zone can be counted. The zones can then be thematically mapped using the <a href="https://www.liamthomasbolton.com/portfolio/FresnelMap/">Fresnel Map</a>, a novel cartographic technique.

This technique has a number of applications in the domain of epidemiology. It could be utilised to study the spread of airborne diseases and address the MAUP in epidemiology. Using the Fresnel Map, the spread of disease could additionally be mapped around an infrastructural node. The technique has applications beyond coronavirus and social distancing and could be utilised to evaluate the effectiveness of previous rules and optimise future pandemic measures.
