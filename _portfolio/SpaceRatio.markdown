As urban space dwindles, it will be increasingly important to create new measures and maps of the density potential in cities.

Space Ratio describes the ratio of the existing density to the permissible density. The latter effectively creates a volumetric parcel of air to outline available space according to the planning or policy context. Space Ratio can incorporate data on a number of density measures such as Floor Area Ratio, building height or dwellings per hectare. Space Ratio calculates the extent to which buildings make use of space: the lower the Space Ratio, the more room there is for residential extensions, for instance.

Space Ratio is a new technique that, if utilised cautiously and contextually, could be deployed by planners and designers to compare density scenarios and facilitate sustainable densification. I apply the technique to develop new measures and maps that convey the amount of space available for new rooftop homes from the building-level to the area-level in London. For example, I produce dasymetric maps of Space Ratio and area-level measures.
