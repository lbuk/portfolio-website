Housing is volumetric. Data on the horizontal stratification of buildings, for instance, is three-dimensional. Traditional ways of mapping three-dimensional space in the built environment can be cluttered and difficult to read. How do you visualise the three-dimensional horizontal stratification of buildings in 2D in a way that's more intuitive?

A very experimental solution to this problem is to horizontally stratify maps of building footprints. These designs show building floors as horizontal strata in the two-dimensional building footprint. The floors of the building can therefore be stacked horizontally in an abstracted map.

Although there are several limitations to this highly abstracted technique, it could provide an alternative way of mapping volumetric data on the stratification of buildings for communities.

This technique can also be used to visualise two-dimensional spatial data such as the provision of affordable housing. Here, the site map has been heavily abstracted to create a square pie chart.
