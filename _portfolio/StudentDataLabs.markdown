Based in Leeds and established in 2015, <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/">Student Data Labs</a> helped university students to gain highly sought-after data skills while working on real-world projects. As ex-Founder, I managed the Labs, which offered a collaborative space for university students from a variety of academic backgrounds to undertake real-world data projects. 

Sponsored by the <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/">Consumer Data Research Centre</a>, Student Data Labs ran Innovation Labs between 2015-2016 in Leeds that focused on <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab">road casualties</a>, <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab">empty housing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/HealthInnovationLab">health</a>. The Vision Zero Innovation Lab also formed part of the 2016 <a href="https://leedsdigitalfestival.org/">Leeds Digital Festival</a>, the largest digital festival in the north of England.
