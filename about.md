I work at the intersection of design, data science and cities. Specialising in GIS and data visualisation, I've developed a number of novel mapping tools such as the <a href="https://www.liamthomasbolton.com/portfolio/FresnelMap/">Fresnel Map</a>.

I'm currently a PhD Architectural Space and Computation student at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/">The Bartlett</a>, UCL. My research explores techniques for mapping airspace development in London. I'm also a Fellow at <a href="http://www.createstreets.com/">Create Streets</a>.

In the past, I've worked with research labs, local authorities, government departments, non-profits, Innovation Labs and news agencies. I recently completed an MSc Smart Cities and Urban Analytics at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)</a>, UCL. I subsequently worked as a Consultant for <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/">The Bartlett School of Architecture</a>. 

Between 2017 and 2018 I worked as an Urban Data Analyst at <a href="http://www.redninja.co.uk/">Red Ninja Studios</a>, a design-led technology company, and <a href="http://isensing.co.uk/">iSensing</a>, an IoT company that provides mobility analytics. Here, I led a planning project and visualised real-time data in Madrid and Sao Paulo. After graduating from the University of Leeds with a First Class (Hons) degree in Social Policy in 2017, I was funded by the Department for Transport to explore how machine learning and big data can be used to model car dependency in West Yorkshire. In 2016 I was awarded a <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2016/09/26/google-fellow-liam-bolton-blogs-about-his-time-at-the-bbc/">Google Fellowship</a> at <a href="http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/">BBC News Labs</a> and the Graphics desk. While at the BBC I contributed to data-driven stories, helped with the production of news applications and worked on a project to encourage trust in news. I've collaborated with the <a href="leeds.theodi.org">Leeds Node of the Open Data Institute (ODI)</a>, <a href="https://www.graphicnews.com/">Graphic News</a>, a news agency specialising in infographics and data visualisation, the <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics</a> and the <a href="http://www.rgs.org/HomePage.htm">Royal Geographical Society</a>. As ex-Founder of <a href="https://studentdatalabs.com/">Student Data Labs</a>, I managed Innovation Labs that aimed to teach practical data skills to university students while tackling problems like <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/EmptyHousingInnovationLab/">empty housing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StudentDataLabs/VisionZeroInnovationLab/">road casualties</a>. In the past I've been funded by the <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/">British Academy</a> and Eliahou Dangoor. I've given talks at the Government Digital Service, the Department for Transport and the launch of the Leeds City Dashboard.
